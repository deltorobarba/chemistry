        "**Interpretation**\n",
        "* The molecule has a strong absorption band around 81.31 nm (corresponding to the first excited state). This transition involves significant electron redistribution along the Z-axis.\n",
        "* The second excited state is \"dark\" (very low oscillator strength), which means that it won't be easily observed in absorption spectroscopy.\n",
        "* The third excited state has a weaker absorption band at 28.26 nm.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Specify atomic coordinates (of Hydrogen molecule) and basis set ('6-31g')**. The choice of basis set significantly impacts the accuracy of the results. Larger basis sets generally lead to improved accuracy but increased computational cost.\n",
        "* **Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) calculation is performed to obtain the ground-state wavefunction**.\n",
        "* **Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is employed for excited-state calculation, using Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA)**.\n",
        "  * TDDFT is just one of several methods for excited-state calculations. Other options in PySCF include configuration interaction singles (CIS), complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF), and equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC).\n",
        "  * For TDDFT, selecting an appropriate functional is crucial. Some functionals are known to perform better for specific types of excited states.\n",
        "* **analyze() function provides summary of calculated excitation energies and oscillator strengths**.\n",
        "* There are alternative excited-state calculation methods for more advanced features: solvent effects, spin-orbit coupling, and non-adiabatic dynamics\n",

        "**Singlet Excitation Energies and Oscillator Strengths:**\n",
        "* Excited State 1:\n",
        "  * Energy: 15.2476 eV\n",
        "  * Wavelength: 81.31 nm (corresponds to the energy difference between the ground and excited state)\n",
        "  * Oscillator Strength (f): 0.7700 (indicates the intensity of the transition; a higher value means a stronger absorption)\n",
        "  * The transition is primarily from orbital 1 to orbital 2 (coefficient 0.70703)\n",
        "* Excited State 2:\n",
        "  * Energy: 28.7709 eV\n",
        "  * Wavelength: 43.09 nm\n",
        "  * Oscillator Strength (f): 0.0000 (this transition is \"forbidden,\" meaning it's very unlikely to occur upon light absorption)\n",
        "  * The transition is primarily from orbital 1 to orbital 3\n",
        "* Excited State 3:\n",
        "  * Energy: 43.8775 eV\n",
        "  * Wavelength: 28.26 nm\n",
        "  * Oscillator Strength (f): 0.1083 (a weaker transition compared to the first excited state)\n",
        "  * The transition is primarily from orbital 1 to orbital 4\n",

        "**Transition Electric/Velocity/Magnetic Dipole Moments:**\n",
        "* tables describe changes in the molecule's electric and magnetic properties upon excitation.\n",
        "* Electric Dipole Moments: Important for light absorption and emission.\n",
        "* Velocity Dipole Moments: Related to the rate of change of the electron density during the transition.\n",
        "* Magnetic Dipole Moments: Relevant for magnetic interactions and certain types of spectroscopy.\n",
        "* here the first excited state has a significant electric dipole transition moment along the Z-axis,consistent with its high oscillator strength. The other states have negligible dipole moments, indicating weak or forbidden transitions."
